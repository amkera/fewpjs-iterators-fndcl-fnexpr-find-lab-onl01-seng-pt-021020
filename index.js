//There is a difference between find and filter. Find returns the first value for which the callback function returns true, but filter returns all of them. 

// let roommates = ["jess", "winston", "winston", "nick"];
 
// roommates.find( function(s) { return s === "winston" })
//=> winston
 
// roommates.filter(function(s) { return s === "winston" })
//=> [winston, winston]
